art is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Google, designed for building web, mobile, server, and desktop applications. It features a C-style syntax and was first unveiled in 2011. Dart has gained significant popularity, particularly due to its integration with the Flutter framework, which allows developers to create high-performance, cross-platform applications from a single codebase.

# What Is Flutter? [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=flutter)](https://skillicons.dev)
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google, designed for building natively compiled applications for multiple platforms from a single codebase. First introduced in 2015 and officially released in May 2017, Flutter allows developers to create applications for iOS, Android, web, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and Google's Fuchsia operating system.

# What Is BMI Application? ‚öñÔ∏è
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a widely used measurement that assesses body fat based on an individual's height and weight. This calculation provides a numerical value which can be categorized into different weight status categories:

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI 18.5 - 24.9
- Overweight: BMI 25 - 29.9
- Obese: BMI ‚â• 30

A BMI calculator is an online tool that simplifies this calculation by requiring users to input their height and weight. The calculator then outputs the BMI value along with the corresponding weight category, helping individuals understand their health status and potential risks related to body weight. While BMI is a useful screening tool, it has limitations as it does not distinguish between muscle and fat mass, and may not accurately reflect health in all individuals, particularly athletes or those with significant muscle mass.
